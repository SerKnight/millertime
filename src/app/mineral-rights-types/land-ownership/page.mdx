# Land Ownership

## Surface Estate Ownership

A person with surface estate ownership owns the land surface but not necessarily the minerals underneath it. The land surface title may be separate from the mineral rights title. If you have surface ownership only, you have the right to use, sell or lease the land surface but no rights to the minerals beneath it.

## What This Means for You

- You own the surface of the land
- You can use, sell, or lease the land surface
- You do not have rights to minerals beneath the surface
- You may have restrictions on surface use if mineral rights are owned by others

## Common Scenarios

Many landowners find themselves in situations where they own the surface but not the mineral rights. This can happen when:

- Mineral rights were previously sold or leased
- The property was inherited with split ownership
- The original deed separated surface and mineral rights

## Questions to Consider

- Do you know if you own the mineral rights under your land?
- Have you received offers to lease your surface for mineral exploration?
- Are you aware of any restrictions on your surface use?
