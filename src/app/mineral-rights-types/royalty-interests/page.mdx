# Royalty Interests

## What Are Royalty Interests?

A person with royalty interests, or a "non-participating royalty interest," has the right to receive royalties – a set percentage of the profit – from minerals on a certain piece of land. If you have a royalty interest, you receive royalties only when there are profits, and you don't have the right to lease the minerals.

## How Royalty Interests Work

### What You Receive:
- A percentage of the gross revenue from mineral production
- Payments only when minerals are actually produced and sold
- No responsibility for development costs or operations

### What You Don't Control:
- When or if development occurs
- How the minerals are extracted
- Lease negotiations with operators
- Development decisions

## Types of Royalty Interests

- **Landowner Royalty**: Typically 12.5% to 25% of production
- **Non-Participating Royalty Interest (NPRI)**: Fixed percentage, no development rights
- **Overriding Royalty Interest**: Percentage carved out of working interest

## Advantages of Royalty Interests

- **Passive Income**: No management responsibility
- **No Development Risk**: You don't bear the cost of drilling or operations
- **Regular Payments**: Receive payments as long as production continues
- **Inheritance Friendly**: Easy to pass to heirs

## Considerations

- **Production Dependent**: Only receive payments when minerals are produced
- **No Control**: Cannot influence development decisions
- **Market Dependent**: Payments fluctuate with commodity prices
- **Tax Implications**: Royalty payments are typically ordinary income

## Questions to Consider

- Do you want ongoing income or a lump sum payment?
- Are you comfortable with the uncertainty of production?
- How important is it to have control over development?
- What are your tax planning goals?
