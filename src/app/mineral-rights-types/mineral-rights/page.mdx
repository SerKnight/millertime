# Mineral Rights

## What Are Mineral Rights?

A person with mineral rights owns the minerals beneath the surface of a certain piece of land. The person often does not own the land surface, but has rights to using the land surface to extract minerals. A person with mineral rights has the ability to sell or lease those rights to someone else â€“ or hold onto the rights and bear the risk and responsibility for extracting the minerals.

## Your Rights and Responsibilities

### What You Can Do:
- Extract minerals yourself (if you have the capability)
- Lease your mineral rights to oil and gas companies
- Sell your mineral rights to other parties
- Receive royalties from production

### What You're Responsible For:
- Managing lease negotiations
- Understanding production risks
- Handling tax implications
- Making decisions about development

## Types of Mineral Rights

- **Working Interest**: You own the right to develop and produce minerals
- **Non-Participating Royalty Interest**: You receive royalties but don't participate in operations
- **Overriding Royalty Interest**: You receive a percentage of production revenue

## Common Minerals
