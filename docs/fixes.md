* logo on mobile is blurry
* phonenumber in header is white on white (cant see) (720) 318-6907
* team page is not formated well.. should have a better flow where up to 6 teeammembres can be viewed easily (use tailwind best practices)
* menu hierarchy and sub pages in footer should be better right now there are 7 and that is hard to view
* contact page form should be better spaced (right now theres 2 forms on the right side stacked)
* general UX and SEO practices should be improved across all pages (recursivel search and apply common patterns where you can)
